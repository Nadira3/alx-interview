# 0x08. Making Change

This project focuses on solving the coin change problem using algorithms, specifically greedy algorithms and dynamic programming, to find the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total.

## Concepts Covered
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Understand the limitations and application of greedy methods.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Learn how to solve optimization problems using overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: Analyze and improve time and space complexity.
- **Python Programming**: Efficient implementation of algorithms.

## Requirements
- Python version: 3.4.3
- Code Style: PEP 8 (v1.7.x)
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project directory.

## Prototype
```python
def makeChange(coins, total):
    """
    Determines the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total.

    Args:
        coins (list): List of coin denominations.
        total (int): Target amount.

    Returns:
        int: Minimum number of coins required to make up the total.
             Returns 0 if total is 0 or less.
             Returns -1 if the total cannot be met with the available coins.
    """
```

## Example Usage
```
makeChange = __import__('0-making_change').makeChange

print(makeChange([1, 2, 25], 37))  # Output: 7
print(makeChange([1256, 54, 48, 16, 102], 1453))  # Output: -1
```
