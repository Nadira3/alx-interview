# Minimum Operations

## Task Overview

This task involves calculating the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly **n** `H` characters in a file, starting with a single `H`. The text editor can only perform two operations:

- **Copy All**: Copies all the characters currently in the file.
- **Paste**: Pastes the copied characters into the file.

You are required to write a function `minOperations(n)` that returns the minimum number of operations required to obtain exactly **n** `H` characters. If it's impossible to achieve **n** characters, return `0`.

### Prototype:
```python
def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculate the minimum operations needed to achieve n 'H' characters.
    """
```
Example:

n = 9
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
Number of operations: 6


Edge Case:

If n == 1, the minimum number of operations is 0 because no copy-paste operations are needed (we already have 1 H).

### Approach

The goal is to find an efficient way to generate n H characters using the minimum number of operations. Here's the general approach:

1. Prime Factorization: The problem can be broken down by treating the goal of reaching n as a series of multiplication steps. Specifically:

For any number n, break it down into its prime factors.

Use the prime factors to determine how many operations are required. Every prime factor will require a combination of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.



2. Greedy Approach: For each factor found, the best approach is to copy the current sequence of H characters and paste it repeatedly until you reach the number of characters that is a multiple of the factor.

### Explanation of Example

Letâ€™s break down the process for n = 9:

1. Start with 1 H.


2. Copy All (Operation 1) and then Paste (Operation 2) to get 2 Hs.


3. Paste (Operation 3) to get 3 Hs.


4. Copy All (Operation 4) at 3 Hs and Paste (Operation 5) to get 6 Hs.


5. Paste (Operation 6) to get 9 Hs.



Thus, the minimum number of operations to get 9 Hs is 6.

Function Signature

Explanation:

We use prime factorization to determine the number of operations.

We incrementally divide n by the smallest possible factors and add the factor count to the number of operations.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/alx-interview.git


2. Navigate to the directory:

cd 0x02-minimum_operations


3. Run the main file to test the function:

python3 0-main.py

### Testing

You can run the test cases in the 0-main.py file to verify the implementation.

Min # of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min # of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
